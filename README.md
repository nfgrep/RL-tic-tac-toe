# RL_tic_tac_toe
A reinforcement learning agent that plays tic-tac-toe

This was inspired by the first bit of [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Sutton and Barto. Something about the tic-tac-toe thought experiment seemed almost too simple, so I figured I'd try it :)
